DATA-DRIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	ENCOURAGE PATRONAGE OF PRODUCTS THAT GENERATES LESS REVENUE
More qualified sales person should be employed to advertise the products that generates less revenue. Discounts can be given to encourage high sales and this can boost up the revenue in the future.
2.	GIVE DISCOUNTS FOR MORE ORDER PURCHASE
Only 2 people purchase above 10 orders, which is not good enough therefore discount can be given to individuals that made 2 or more orders. This would encourage patronage of bulk orders and increase the number of orders purchase over time.
3.	ENCOURAGE MORE SALES AND PURCHASE IN OTHER MONTHS OF THE YEAR.
Experts should be engaged that would look into the factors that made sales volumn and revenue to be high in the month of September, and these factors can be applied in other months of the year to improve sales and revenue. 


4.	MONITOR AND VISUALIZE SUPPLIER KPIS
What gets measured gets managed. What to Track:
•	On-time delivery rate
•	Fill rate
•	Average and variance in lead time
•	Quality metrics
•	Communication responsiveness

5.	RENEGOTIATE LEAD TIME OR PENALTY CLAUSES
Introduce penalties for delays or bonuses for early/on-time delivery. Or restructure contracts to include more agile terms for suppliers.
6.	GIVE BONUSES TO BEST CUSTOMERS
Joshua Robinson who has been the customer who has spent the most on a single transaction should be given bonuses that would encourage other customers to spend more to attract such bonuses.
7.	Bundle or Cross-Sell
Create product bundles (e.g. 3 for $10) or themed kits — this raises perceived value and average order value.
Offer "frequently bought together" suggestions or discounts.
8.	Analize the "Why" Behind Cancellations of Already Ordered Products
Analize why products are being cancelled after order, reach out to the customers, offer them discounts or free shipping.
Encourage them with a rebuy policy where they get free gift for reordering any product that they previously cancelled.
